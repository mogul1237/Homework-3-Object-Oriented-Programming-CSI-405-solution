Problem 1 (edu.albany.cruise, edu.albany.cargo)
Model Ship, CruiseShip and CargoShip classes
Design a ship class that has the following members:
1. A field for the name of the ship (string)
2. A field for the year that the ship was built (string)
3. A constructor and appropriate accessors and mutators
4. A toString method that displays the ship’s name and the year it was built
Design a CruiseShip class that extends the Ship class. The CruiseShip class should have the following
members:
1. A field for the maximum number of passengers (int)
2. A constructor and appropriate accessors and mutators
3. A toString method that overrides the toString method in the base class. The CruiseShip class’s
toString method should display only the ship’s name and the maximum number of passengers
Design a CargoShip class that extends the Ship class. The CargoShip class should habe the following
members:
1. A field for the cargo capacity in tonnage (int)
2. A constructor and appropriate accessors and mutators
3. A toString method that overrides the toString method in the base class. The CargoShip class’s
toString method should display only the ship’s name and the ship’s cargo capacity
Demonstrate the classes in a program that has a Ship array. Assign various Ship, CruiseShip and
CargoShip objects to the array elements. The program should then step through the array, calling each
object’s toString method.
Problem 2 (edu.albany.your_package_names)
Create packages as needed per design
Create classes modeling the purchase of sandwich / sandwiches at a typical sandwich shop. Use three
objects: Cashier, Customer, SandwichMaker. (You can add more classes if you want but these three
should be present in the project)
Follow the steps to complete the homework:
1. Create a sequence / flow diagram – This diagram would show how an interaction is initiated.
Also it shows which class will initiate which other class
2. Indicate what information (if any) is passed between the classes
3. Figure out what instance variables will be needed in each of the classes
4. Create UML diagrams – The UML diagrams should follow the exact formatting shown in class
slides. Submit UML diagrams in a separate folder as images with your code submission.
5. Create all the classes
6. Create a driver class (SandwichDriver) to test the functionality
7. Handle all possible errors with try catch blocks wherever necessary
Note: There is no one solution for the homework. Each person can think differently.
Grading
Implementation 40%
Execution 40%
UML diagrams 10%
Code clarity / organization 10%
Sequence diagram 5%
Submission
Check exact deadlines on blackboard. Deadlines are followed strictly when grading. No excuses. Check
deadline policy in syllabus
Submit any specific instructions needed for grading/executing your homework.
Your project(s) should be a 7-zip (or any other zip format) file submitted on blackboard. It should be an
eclipse project that the grader can import into his/her eclipse environment and execute. If this criterion
is not followed you will lose points.
The UML diagrams should be submitted separately in the same submission as a folder of images well
labelled/organized. (Not inside the project archive). Same for sequence diagram(s).
Follow exact deadlines, timing on blackboard. Rules for late submission apply as per syllabus.
Follow naming conventions posted on blackboard.
